  <h5>This is a Movie API App.</h5>
  <p>
  To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
  application will provide users with access to information about different
  movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
  personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
  </p>
  <p>
  Whenever users of mycommedyFlix are interacting with the application, the server-side of the
  application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the
  data in the database. Users will be able to use the mycomedyFlix application whenever they like
  to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
  list of “Favorite Movies.”
